# alphazero-minichess
This project is an attempt to utilize the AlphaZero algorithm to create an engine that can play Gardner Minichess.

Current (rough) to-do list:

1. Refine and update the game representation with adaptability to AlphaZero in mind
2. Implement base AlphaZero functionality
3. Test training for minichess, potentially implement other game for testing purposes
